# MCC2-Snake_Game
Final project for the Microcontrollers 2 course, where a Snake game was developed using Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) concepts with an STM32, programmed within its own platform.

Source code is available in ```Core/Src``` and ```Core/Inc```. Everything else is from STM32 IDE itself.
